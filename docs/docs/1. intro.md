## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up AltMount with Docker and integrate it with your media management tools.

### 1. Run AltMount with Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  altmount:
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
    image: ghcr.io/javi11/altmount:latest
    container_name: altmount
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - PORT=8080
      - COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost # Must match the domain/IP where web interface is accessed
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /mnt:/mnt:rshared # Linux only - see Rclone Mount section for macOS/Windows
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped
    devices:
      - /dev/fuse:/dev/fuse:rwm
    cap_add:
      - SYS_ADMIN
    security_opt:
      - apparmor:unconfined
```

**Important**: Set `COOKIE_DOMAIN` to match how you'll access the web interface:

- For `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`: Use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost`
- For specific IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`): Use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=192.168.1.100`
- For domain (e.g., `altmount.example.com`): Use `COOKIE_DOMAIN=altmount.example.com`

Start the service:

```bash
mkdir -p ./config/metadata
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Create a New User

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
2. On first access, you'll be prompted to create an admin user
3. Enter your desired username and password
4. Complete the initial setup

### 3. Configure Rclone Mount

AltMount includes a built-in rclone mount feature for the WebDAV interface:

> **⚠️ Important: macOS and Windows Users**
>
> The built-in rclone mount only works **inside the Linux container**. Due to Docker Desktop architecture limitations, FUSE mounts created inside containers cannot be directly accessed from macOS or Windows hosts.
>
> **Solution for macOS/Windows hosts:**
>
> Install rclone on your host system and mount the AltMount WebDAV endpoint:
>
> **macOS:**
>
> ```bash
> # Install rclone and macFUSE
> brew install rclone macfuse
>
> # Create cache directory
> mkdir -p ~/.cache/rclone
>
> # Step 1: Create rclone WebDAV config (adjust credentials)
> rclone config create altmount webdav \
>   url http://localhost:8080 \
>   vendor other \
>   user your-username \
>   pass $(rclone obscure "your-password")
>
> # Step 2: Mount AltMount with VFS cache
> rclone mount altmount: /Users/your-username/mnt/altmount \
>   --vfs-cache-mode full \
>   --vfs-cache-max-size 50G \
>   --vfs-cache-max-age 504h \
>   --vfs-read-chunk-size 32M \
>   --vfs-read-ahead 128M \
>   --dir-cache-time 10m \
>   --cache-dir ~/.cache/rclone \
>   --allow-other \
>   --daemon
> ```
>
> **Windows:**
>
> ```powershell
> # Install rclone and WinFsp from https://rclone.org and https://winfsp.dev
>
> # Create cache directory
> New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\rclone\cache"
>
> # Step 1: Create rclone WebDAV config (adjust credentials)
> # First, obscure your password:
> $obscuredPass = rclone obscure "your-password"
>
> # Then create the config:
> rclone config create altmount webdav `
>   url http://localhost:8080 `
>   vendor other `
>   user your-username `
>   pass $obscuredPass
>
> # Step 2: Mount AltMount with VFS cache
> rclone mount altmount: X: ^
>   --vfs-cache-mode full ^
>   --vfs-cache-max-size 50G ^
>   --vfs-cache-max-age 504h ^
>   --vfs-read-chunk-size 32M ^
>   --vfs-read-ahead 128M ^
>   --dir-cache-time 10m ^
>   --cache-dir %LOCALAPPDATA%\rclone\cache
> ```
>
> For more details, see the [rclone installation guide](https://rclone.org/install/).

**For Linux hosts** (or container-internal use only):

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Rclone** (`/config/rclone`)
2. **Enable rclone mount** by toggling the switch
3. Configure the **mount path** (e.g., `/mnt/altmount`)
4. Adjust cache settings as needed (defaults are usually fine)
5. **Save** the configuration
6. Click **Start Mount** to activate the rclone mount

The mount will now be available at the configured path inside the container.

### 4. Add a Usenet Provider

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **Providers** (`/config/providers`)
2. Click **Add Provider**
3. Enter your Usenet provider details:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name for your provider
   - **Host**: NNTP server address
   - **Port**: Usually 563 (SSL) or 119 (non-SSL)
   - **Username**: Your provider username
   - **Password**: Your provider password
   - **Max Connections**: Number of simultaneous connections (e.g., 20)
   - **Enable SSL/TLS**: Recommended for security
4. **Save** the provider configuration

![Add Usenet provider configuration](/img/add_provider.png)

### 5. Enable SABnzbd API

1. Go to **Configuration** → **SABnzbd** (`/config/sabnzbd`)
2. **Enable SABnzbd API compatibility**
3. Set **Complete directory** to `/complete` (or `/` for mount root)
4. Add categories for your media:
   - Click **Add Category**
   - Name: `tv`, Directory: `tv`, Priority: Normal
   - Click **Add Category** again
   - Name: `movies`, Directory: `movies`, Priority: Normal
5. **Choose Import Strategy**: Select how imported files should be made available to external applications:

   - **NONE (Direct WebDAV)**: Use the WebDAV mount directly without additional file organization. This is the simplest option and works with most media servers.

   - **Symlinks**: Creates category-based symbolic links for easier access by external applications. Works with Plex and other media servers that support symlinks.

     - Toggle **Enable Symlinks**
     - Set **Symlink Directory** to an absolute path (e.g., `/symlinks`)
     - Files will be organized by category in the symlink directory

   - **STRM**: Generates STRM streaming files that point to the WebDAV content. Works with Emby, Jellyfin, and other media servers that support STRM files.
     - Toggle **Enable STRM**
     - Set **STRM Directory** to an absolute path (e.g., `/strm`)
     - STRM files will be organized by category in the STRM directory

   See [Import Strategy Configuration](Configuration/integration#import-strategy-configuration) for detailed setup and advanced options.

6. **(Optional) Enable Fallback Host**: For advanced users who need to send failed imports to an external SABnzbd instance:
   - Toggle **Enable Fallback Host**
   - Set **Fallback Host** to the URL of the external SABnzbd instance
   - Set **Fallback API Key** to the API key of the external SABnzbd instance
   - This will send failed imports to the external SABnzbd instance
   - See [Fallback Host Configuration](Configuration/integration#fallback-host-configuration) for detailed setup
7. **Save** the configuration

![SABnzbd API configuration with categories](/img/sabnzbd_config.png)

### 6. Configure ARR Integration

AltMount automatically integrates with Sonarr/Radarr when you add it as a SABnzbd download client. The ARR instance will be automatically registered using credentials embedded in the SABnzbd client configuration.

#### Add AltMount as Download Client in ARRs

1. Open your Sonarr/Radarr web interface
2. Go to **Settings** → **Download Clients**
3. Click the **+** button and select **SABnzbd**
4. Configure the client with these **important credential mappings**:
   - **Name**: `AltMount`
   - **Host**: `altmount` (or your AltMount server IP/hostname)
   - **Port**: `8080`
   - **Username**: Your ARR URL (e.g., `http://sonarr:8989` for Sonarr, `http://radarr:7878` for Radarr)
   - **Password**: Your ARR API Key (found in ARR **Settings** → **General** → **Security**)
   - **Category**: Set to `tv` (for Sonarr) or `movies` (for Radarr)
   - **Base Path**: Set to `sabnzbd` (in advanced settings) to ensure proper API routing
5. **Test** the connection to verify it works
6. **Save** the download client

**How Automatic Registration Works:**

- When AltMount receives the first request from your ARR app, it reads the **Username** (ARR URL) and **Password** (ARR API Key) from the SABnzbd client configuration
- AltMount automatically registers the ARR instance using these credentials
- No manual configuration in AltMount settings is required

**Verify Integration:**

1. Navigate to **Configuration** → **ARR Integration** (`/config/arrs`) in AltMount
2. You should see your ARR instance(s) automatically listed after the first download request
3. The instance will show the URL and type (Sonarr/Radarr) extracted from the credentials

**Important**: In your ARR application settings:

- Go to **Settings** → **Media Management**
- Enable **Use Hardlinks instead of Copy** to prevent unnecessary file duplication if you are using the import strategy "NONE"
- This allows efficient file management between the mount and your media library

### 7. Enable Health & Repair System

AltMount includes an intelligent health monitoring system that automatically discovers, validates, and repairs files in your media library.

1. Go to **Configuration** → **Health** (`/config/health`)
2. **Enable health system** by toggling the switch
3. **Configure Library Directory** (required):
   - Set to the path where your media library files are stored (e.g., `/Users/javi/mio/library`)
   - This is where your symlinks or STRM files point to AltMount content
   - The system will sync with this directory to discover and monitor files
4. **(Optional) Enable Cleanup Orphaned Metadata Files**:
   - Toggle this option to automatically delete metadata files that no longer have corresponding files in your library
   - **⚠️ Warning**: This performs bidirectional cleanup. Metadata files without library files AND library files pointing to missing metadata will both be permanently deleted. Metadata can be recreated during re-import.
   - Only enable if you want to automatically clean up orphaned files
   - Requires Library Directory to be configured

**Advanced Settings** (optional):

- **Check Interval**: Time between automatic health checks (default: 5 seconds)
- **Max Connections for Health Checks**: Maximum concurrent NNTP connections during validation (default: 5)
- **Segment Sample Percentage**: Percentage of segments to check for faster validation (default: 5%)
- **Library Sync Interval**: How often to sync with library directory (default: 60 minutes, set to 0 to disable)

**Save** the configuration to activate the health monitoring system.
