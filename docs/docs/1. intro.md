# Getting Started with AltMount

Welcome to **AltMount** - a high-performance WebDAV server backed by NZB/Usenet that provides seamless streaming and integration with media management tools.

## What is AltMount?

AltMount is a modern WebDAV server that bridges the gap between Usenet/NZB downloads and your media applications. It provides:

- **WebDAV Interface**: Mount NZB content as a standard filesystem via WebDAV
- **Streaming Capability**: Stream media files directly from Usenet without full downloads
- **Media Integration**: Native integration with Radarr, Sonarr, and other ARR applications
- **SABnzbd Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for SABnzbd with existing workflows
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and automatic repair capabilities
- **Web Interface**: Modern React-based web UI for configuration and monitoring

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes with our installation guides:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker" default>

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  altmount:
    image: ghcr.io/javi11/altmount:latest
    container_name: altmount
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - PORT=8080
      - HOST=0.0.0.0
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./metadata:/metadata
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test:
        [
          "CMD",
          "wget",
          "--no-verbose",
          "--tries=1",
          "--spider",
          "http://localhost:8080/live",
        ]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

Then run:

```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p ./config ./metadata

# Start the service
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f altmount
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

```bash
# Download latest release
wget https://github.com/javi11/altmount/releases/latest/download/altmount-linux-amd64

# Make executable
chmod +x altmount-linux-amd64

# Create config from sample
cp config.sample.yaml config.yaml

# Edit configuration
nano config.yaml

# Start AltMount
./altmount-linux-amd64 serve --config=config.yaml
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
